# Spelling

All code is written and commented using English (US), which is a widely adopted practice in the industry. The Code Spell Checker extension for VS Code is used to ensure that text is spelled correctly in both code and in UI localized values for the English language. When an unrecognized word is encountered, ensure that it is spelled correctly before adding it to the dictionary. The dictionary is located in the root folder of each repository and is named 'cspell.json'. All repositories use the same mechanism for verifying spelling.
